a- Assume that the prior probabilities for the first two categories are equal (洧녞(洧랪1)=洧녞(洧랪2)=1/2 洧녩nd 洧녞(洧랪3)=0) and design dichotomizer for those two categories using only the 洧논洧논1 feature value.
b- Determine the empirical training error on your samples, that is the percentage of points misclassified.
c- Repeat all above, but now use two feature values, 洧논洧논1,洧논洧논2
d- Repeat all above but use all three feature values
